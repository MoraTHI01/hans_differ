context_full="Then we start the story now. The fewest historical epochs have been officially announced. So we have in our historical analysis a few epochs that have relatively clear beginning and end dates. The time of National Socialism can be relatively clear with the election of Hitler as Chancellor of the Reich and with the defeat of the German Reich in the Second World War. As complex epochs as the Middle Ages have no official beginning and no official end. At some point someone didn't stand up and say, from tomorrow 12 o'clock is the Middle Ages. And then at some point said, from tomorrow 12 o'clock the Middle Ages is over again. But we have a constant development in human history and also in history in the different eras. And in retrospect, the historians have given certain time periods certain labels. And one label that you may know is the label of the Antiquity. The old Greeks, the old Romans, those of you who enjoyed Latin in school, have spent a lot of time with it. And nowadays the beginning of the Middle Ages is generally defined as the fall of the Western Roman Empire, 475-476 after Christ. Depending on that, you can see it differently. But it is over a thousand years long. So far, there are hardly any other eras in history, especially in modern history. Of course, this is not homogeneous. If you imagine 400-500 after Christ, then some Vikings moved through the area up to the discovery of America, there are already gradations in the development. They are not particularly important to us, just so you've heard it. Carl the Great was from 768 to 814. 1096-1099, the first Crusade. The Crusades are a relatively often discussed game form in the media of the European Middle Ages. The background was that the Christian or Catholic parts of Europe, with religious reasons, have led field trips against non-Christian parts of Europe for the first time. Albania was Moorish for a long time. And then, especially for the liberation of the Holy Land, more or less the area of the world, which is now called Israel, have gone to war, have gone there with armies, to free the Holy Land from the pagans. There were several Crusades, which you have to see in a complex way. So certainly it was not a pure exodus of piousness, where you can say, man, they were so pious. Of course, it was not just pure wickedness, and with a stupid religious motive, to break into other countries. That was very multifaceted. Certainly there was also an aspect of getting rid of the lustful nobility. There were many different levels, why Crusades were carried out. You have to look more closely. The good thing is, for the development of social work, the Crusades were relatively irrelevant. 1152-1190, the first Barbarossa. 1347, an important point, that's when the first plague epidemics occurred. The plague is a very contagious disease. By now we know that it propagates through parasites, which live in the fields of rats. These are some fleas. It's a pretty deadly story, if you don't have antibiotics. In the Middle Ages, they didn't exist. In pretty unhygienic conditions, they spread very quickly. Which led to epidemics, especially in medieval cities, have led to an enormous outbreak. The end of the Middle Ages is also discussed. As I said, nobody said, today the Middle Ages is over. Points that are drawn up again and again, to describe the end of the Middle Ages, are all roughly built in a similar league. One point that is brought up, is the invention of book printing. Book printing was a media revolution, which many compare to today's digitalization wave. Because suddenly knowledge, which was only available very narrowly until now, namely in books, which some monks have manipulated, were almost infinitely multiple. Instead of a monk, scribbling a page one day, the whole thing was printed a hundred times, a thousand times. That was a form of multiplication of knowledge, which had an epochal extent. You can no longer imagine today, books, I don't know if it's still clear to you at all, that they exist outside of Kindle. But back then it was a quantum leap. Also for education, also for political movement, if we think about flyers and stuff like that, you can't even assess high enough for the cultivation of man, in the sense of culture, science and the like. That was 1445. Then, as you noted, a popular end of the Middle Ages is the discovery of America. You know, for a long time people assumed that we live on a disc and therefore it is relatively dangerous to sail west, because it will stop at some point. Columbus also had a misjudgment. He thought the earth is a ball and if it goes west long enough, an Indian will come out again. He didn't know that there was still a small continent in the way. Accordingly, the inhabitants of this supposed India were also called Indians, which was not true at all. This is also often seen as the end of the Middle Ages. The Reformation is also seen as the end of the Middle Ages, because the total domination of the Catholic Church was then broken. You can discuss it, it is not so important to us. It is more important to me that you are half-oriented. And if you see any ships that come from America with plundered gold, then you have an idea, that was definitely already at the end of the Middle Ages. Probably it was already through. What did the Middle Ages do? Actually, you can culturally limit it to the time between Antiquity and Modernity. Antiquity became particularly relevant for Modernity, because many modern currents have oriented themselves again to Antiquity. So that the picture was often built up, which is not true, that between the Antiquity, the wonderful high culture of the Romans and the new wonderful high culture of the Renaissance and similar times, the dark Middle Ages lay, where people in their filth vegetated and waited for that you have such a high-quality culture again like the Romans. That's not right, but it was often communicated like that. We have already mentioned the importance of the Catholic Church. We'll take a closer look at that. In the absence of another church, the Catholic Church was the only Christian church and was incredibly important for the whole spiritual and spiritual life. I would go so far in the Middle Ages to see both spiritually and spiritually. The church had an incredible importance both in the explanation of the world, be it in a religious sense, that she explained to us what God wants from us, why he created us, how we should live, as well as in all scientific questions. They were closely linked. So the authority of the church was immense. You can no longer imagine that today. Even if you are very religious, Catholics or Protestants, the power that the church, especially in the high Middle Ages, had over the spiritual world of people at that time, I think it is very difficult for us to perceive. Parallel to this was feudalism, the state form. That means we had a small number of nobles, who, by God's grace, were legitimized to rule over the rest of the population. They did not only deprive the land of their farmers, but the farmers were legitimate. That actually means a form of slavery. They belonged to their master and he could do with them what he wanted. We also had justice systems for a long time, justice systems at that time, which rated the death of a nobleman and the death of a nobleman in a completely different way. In many areas, the non-noblemen were free will for noblemen. Especially if you now think about how they design their historical streaming, the cathedral series on Netflix, it is beautiful to see how the fate of the non-noblemen was shaped by how the noblemen were just trying to find their fun. There was a clear status structure, which also clearly regulated where newborns were sorted. So if you were a child from an aristocratic family, then you were also aristocratic. If you came from another state, then you stayed in this state. The stables in the Middle Ages were originally three stables. The highest position, which we see here in the contemporary representation, was the priesthood, the church. The middle position, the aristocracy, but especially the warriors. And the lowest position, the farmers. There we see an interesting parallel to our little zombie apocalypse. They had all the warriors in their mini-state. Even there, the Middle Ages was a turbulent time. The state order was created by the fact that the respective prince of the country or prince of the aristocracy, who was responsible for the area in which they lived, had access to soldiers. Policemen were still very uniform at the time. He had armed men who carried out his will. That is, therefore, this aristocracy, from which he arose, the caste of those who were able to use violence, weapon violence, to enforce the will of the noble. Both inside, to their own farmers, if they did not want to give their taxes, the soldiers came and got them, as well as to the outside. This was also a legitimate structure at first, that one said, we have farmers. The farmers provide for the livelihood. Without farmers, the warriors are pretty hungry relatively quickly and go looking for food and have to plunder or burn treasures somewhere. Without food, the priests are also pretty stupid relatively quickly. They can't feed themselves. That means we need this farmer's position. The farmer's position alone is not survivable in an anarchist world. If they farm in front of each other, they order their land, feed their pigs and goats and are completely delivered when I say to myself, I'm going to be so stupid and feed goats. I take a stick, go to the neighbor and get his goats for him. That means, logically, a structure develops in which smaller communities We farmers take this one warrior. He's supposed to be a really good warrior. He's not supposed to spend his time protecting or feeding pigs. He's supposed to practice sword fighting so that he defends us when the neighbor comes over. That's why we feed him, feed him and he protects us. This is a social division of labor that has its justification and is also functional. At some point you will also realize that it makes sense if we have people who have scientific knowledge. When we discuss science, you might think of nuclear bombs or computer systems that are being developed. The medieval farmer would not have shared half of his pig with them. The role of science back then was the role of the church and a very crucial factor was meteorology. Not because the farmer's wife wanted to sunbathe and therefore wanted to know when the sun was shining, but it was crucial for the success of agriculture that you knew when to sow and when to harvest. If you sow too early and the young plants freeze up, then you have a need for hunger. In the Middle Ages, it was not possible to say we buy our food there. Either your farm worked and you had food, or it did not work and you had no food. And for that it was a crucial task of the priests in every culture to make the prediction when to sow and when to harvest. It is still the case today if you want to predict the macro weather, if you want to know when is a good time to sow the tomatoes in your garden, then you have to know when is a good time to harvest. This year is incredibly late for Easter, end of April. You will have a weather like we have until the end of April. The priests of every culture spent a lot of time observing the weather and laid the calendar about this weather phenomenon. It is no surprise that Easter is just when nature awakens again. It is not about laying eggs, it is about the resurrection of Jesus Christ. So this motif is life comes back. And of course it is cool when I do that when everything blooms everywhere. Similar to the storage of Christmas on the winter sun and similar. This means the job originally in the medieval sense and in the idealistic sense where you have not yet had a misdevelopment of the priesthood to contribute know-how so that the whole thing works. But also to provide the ethical foundation. To provide the basis for justice. The laws of the church were the laws according to which society worked. That means we had here the intellectual overhead of society in the position of the priest. We have here another representation that supports this. And those of you who thought after school I will never need Latin again, they were wrong. Here we have Tuor Labora for the farmer's position. Where are the Latin women and Latin men? Tuor Labora. What do we have? Work. Ora is the job of Christendom. Pray. Exactly, the Benedictines united. Ora et Labora. And here for the nobility Protege. Protector. To protect and to serve. This was the social division of labor as it was first applied in the Middle Ages in European. Which from this logic also had a justification and also a certain functional ability as long as all involved in their respective position considered rights and duties balanced. The thrill and horror of the Middle Ages that you see in all possible film depictions is that the respective representatives have not played their role as one would like. There we have cruel, greedy nobility who squeeze their farmers to the point where it is no longer possible. There we have corrupt priests who in the form of ablution let their service go gold. But it worked for a long time. This must not be overlooked. We have at least an epoch of over 1000 years. Nevertheless, it is of course wrong to idealize the Middle Ages. If we look at ourselves, we have lived the people. Some of you have already mentioned it in the group. There were a lot of poor people. Especially if we look at poverty more closely. Especially in the cities poverty was concentrated. There were poor neighborhoods. Independent not only in the poor neighborhoods, but also the living conditions were incredibly unhygienic. The Romans had sewage systems. This knowledge has been lost in the Middle Ages. If you go to a Middle Ages market today and are perhaps a little bit in muddy gravel roads, you can get an impression of what the streets must have been like in the Middle Ages. The whole code was on the streets. People threw their garbage into the streets. It must have stank horribly. Of course, it was an ideal nutrient for sewage. The scientific know-how of the time was not enough to see a clear connection. Nevertheless, it was also important not to live in the streets. Just because it stank. For those who could afford it, there were possibilities. Riding a horse ensures that your feet are not in the dirt. And then corresponding hygiene possibilities. But hygiene as we know it today, that everyone takes a shower every morning, was not in the agenda at the time. There are reports that explain the invention of perfume to cover the body odor of the person. The background was that in the early Middle Ages the cities were very small and there were many villages. In the village, the number of people per square meter was a different structure. The course of time has continually enlarged the cities with a few short impacts where cities were destroyed. And the more they had a city structure, the worse the hygienic conditions in the cities became. The villages remained half the same. We have already said poverty. In sociology, with Mrs. Fromm or Mrs. Rosenkranz, what is poverty? If we assume a primary poverty, that we say the income is less than the physical minimum existence, there are estimates that in the Middle Ages about 20% of the population had this form of poverty. That means 107% of the Germans can not calculate percent. 20% means every fifth. If you look here, the rows have 10 places. We do not have fully occupied rows. You can just count in front of you. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and the one would be poor, primarily poor. That does not mean that he can only afford a prepaid mobile phone, but he has less than the minimum existence. He is actually threatened by starvation if he does not steal, beg or do something. Every fifth here in the room. If we add up the poverty a little bit and say not only that direct starvation is a sign of poverty, but poverty is also if a proper way of life is not possible, then it was about 60% of the population. So there is also a poor nobleman who somehow gets through with some activities, but does not live in a noble way. In this respect, there was no middle class and great poverty was correct. So there were many people who had to live in poor conditions. The poorest of the poor, also those who are relevant for social work or the predecessors of it, were certain social groups. Some of them move through the centuries and remain clients of social work. Others have found other forms over time. Independent craftsmen with low incomes, so maybe you know this from representations, the wandering kettle flipper or so were acutely threatened by poverty. People without vocational training already started back then. So the unqualified day laborers were back then like today those who were at the lower edge of income development and were thus threatened by poverty. There were also other social professions, especially funerals, playboys and prostitutes. Prostitution was still clearly seen as a moral decline of the prostitutes. Any other more modern insights on this, especially on the moral situation of freedom, were not of importance back then. But also playboys, the whole driving people, widows and orphans also. You may think today from a young age, from nature, in social security systems and say, well, if someone is widowed or wise, then society has to take care of him. That is polite and nice of them. That was not the case in the Middle Ages. If you were married to a man who died in the war or so, then he was gone for the time being and then no one cared for you. Depending on the situation, you could order your own farm or similar, partly you were a free man. But there was no socially structured care for people who could not take care of themselves or were in an association, such as a marriage or a family, where they are taken care of. Just as sick or people with disabilities, if they could not take care of their livelihood, then they did something else. But, and now we come to a very important point, why it was important to me that we still look at the Middle Ages. We have already said, the Catholic Church, the doctrine of the Catholic Church was crucial for the attitude of the spirit in the Middle Ages. We have to put a little effort into that now. From today's point of view, we cannot imagine it that way. We have to understand that everything that the Church preaches, from their point of view, is actually the absolute truth. That means, if a priest tells you, if you do not do X or Y, you are threatened with eternal damnation, then you believe it. And that's right, not just a little bit, maybe I should fast a little before Easter. That means, in order to understand the Middle Ages, you must first understand that the doctrine in the minds of people was much stronger than it is today. More like you see today scientific facts as a fact. No idea that the earth is a ball. In that logic you have to see it. You don't know if the earth is a ball either. Maybe you have some stupid internet conspiracy theories about it. In fact, you cannot understand it sensibly that the earth is a ball. Even if they fly, they are a little bit curved. But these are truths that you inevitably see as true. It was similar with the teachings of the church, especially towards the early and high Middle Ages, which were believed. And if we lay this down, then we have to look at the church doctrine of the time. Even the Catholic Church has introduced a few updates since the Middle Ages. In the logic of the time, it was clear that God created this world. God as all-powerful, all-knowing and good. And the almighty, good God who creates an earth with people, he thought of something. That is, the life as we imagine it is the expression of the will of God. And since it is God's will that it is as it is, it is not criticized at first. This is of course much easier as a nobleman than as a poor man. If I am born as a nobleman, with a golden spoon between my teeth, then I have a lot to do with assuming that this is the will of God and that it would be nonsense to question it. This is also the reason why the whole thing did not hold up so well in the long run. But in the basic logic first, if we recognize that the world is as it is because God created it and that it is God's will, then poverty is also God's will. Just as God wanted some of you to be noblemen, God wanted some of you to be poor. As a result, if you are the poor, I do not give you any preference. The fact that, let's take an example how I like it better, I am the nobleman, you are the poor. The fact that I am the nobleman and you are the poor is both God's will. Just as you are not allowed to grumble that I am nobleman, may I give you preference that you are poor? That means I may not give you preference that you are poor because you are lazy or because you are stupid. On the contrary, God created it that way and even then the teaching was that the state of poverty is more God-pleasing than that of the rich. That means, as far as I follow these thoughts and say, God created us that way, I am poor, I am rich, then I have to follow that if I want to have a chance in eternity, which came relatively soon in the Middle Ages because you were probably already dead at the age of 30 or 40, that I have to do something for this eternity that I do not go to hell. And my job was to give alms. It was necessary for my soul healing in eternity, which I really believed in, that I, as a rich man, give alms to the poor. And that is the logic of the medieval Caritas. Caritas, the Latin women are again in favor of next love, who designed the world in such a way that it is a God-willing state. The poor is God-pleasing more than the rich. And the rich has the obligatory duty to give alms. Alms are today so small things. From this logic, he really had to give with full hands to make his access to heaven. So that we have here a view of poverty and wealth, which is hardly imaginable to this day. From that point of view, it would have been unthinkable to approach poor people with the dogma of supporting and demanding and to say, you poor, you are lazy, do something. This is not to be seen from the classical medieval Caritas perspective. He is poor, well, God wanted it that way, I am rich, God wanted it that way, I give him alms, everything is fine. He has to pray for me when I give him alms, I give him alms, so we can both end up in heaven. This is a basic idea that is functional. If not, and that was a big problem in the Middle Ages, certain parts of this worldview have exploited the whole thing. So this is of course a strong pretext for oppression. If God wanted me to be rich and you poor, and I have the rights of the noble, then I can end up as a nobleman, God wanted it that way. And I can serve you and torture you and do what I want with you. So that the whole thing has not developed functionally over time. Likewise, the church organizations have also received alms. For me, for my salvation, it doesn't matter if I give my alms to you or to the church or to someone else. This is irrelevant. The important thing is, I give my alms. If I give my alms to the church, the church can of course take care of the poor. They have done this in many cities. In Nuremberg, you can't talk small. But of course the churches have also built their churches with the alms. And especially the structures of so semi-worldly church princes, the bishops who had their own bishops, it turned out that the church became relatively rich in the respective bishops or areas of the certain monasteries, so that the logic was no longer verified and the moment became visible. God may have wanted it that way. You poor, I rich, I give, you pray for me. But somehow it became noticeable that the poor, the servants of this church, who also preach this poverty, live in golden palaces. The servants of this church enrich themselves with alms, so that the system was then questioned. And also the entire logic behind it was questioned. This will of God behind it, which then finally paved the way for the Reformation. That's what it was all about. It is important to me for our further work that you understand that it is God's will that there are rich and poor and I make no accusation to the poor that he is poor. On the contrary, I even have a little bad conscience towards him, because I know that he is more God-friendly than me. This is a basic attitude that with the Reformation is no longer found in the bulk of society. And this departure from this basic attitude makes all forms of social work possible. All forms of social work, the care that is designed to make the poor no longer poor, through any intervention, through pedagogy, through promotion, by force, to ensure that they no longer stand in front of the church and pray, but earn their livelihood, leaves this logic of the medieval Caritas. What is important to me is that it must be clear to you that for hundreds of years in Europe this was the normal basic attitude. That means it has not always been that we have to do something so that the poor can earn their livelihood themselves. We could also see poverty as morally unproblematic, not as an individual failure of the poor, but as a state that just came to help the poor. And I don't have to blame him for being lazy, stupid or anything else. But I accept the state and just help him. This is very important to me, that you recognize that there was this perception of poverty and still exists today. So there are various parts of the world where the current world order is directly at the will of the religious community or the respective religion where nothing can be changed. There is also in the milder sense in today's church social doctrine the access that people who are clients of social work are accepted as they are and not necessarily want to make them functional parts of society. This is the background why we should have small light bulbs. The historically oriented among you know of course that there is no indication that the light bulb was invented. It is a characterization of topics that have a longer meaning in our discourse. This means that they are not only relevant for the Middle Ages, but also for other issues. It does not mean that the light bulb was invented in the Middle Ages. How did it go? With our worldview on the social, on poverty. In the late Middle Ages this idea took over that I can pay off my sins by donations, because the church has exaggerated it with the ablution trade. I could do what I wanted, buy an ablution in a comfortable situation. If I say I can do what I want, when I go out, I kill someone, buy an ablution and everything is fine, then you can already get a lot of money. And in the long run, it is of course also something that questions the overall structure for those who suffer under this social structure. Accordingly, the Reformation came up. The Reformation criticized this ablution trade. What started in addition to this ablution trade was a very decisive turn in evening thinking. This fatalistic attitude that says everything here is an expression of the will of God. And the world order is as God thought it was and good. The idea of the church that we as people change something in this world, which God gave us, was given to us precisely by the Reformation. It was not only Luther, there were other thinkers, Calvinists and the like, who put this view more and more that man has his own responsibility for his fate, that God gave us The thought goes on into liberalism, into the liberal ideas of Europe, of the New Age, who said no, we as humans, even if we are creatures of God, have freedom, freedom of decision and freedom of design for our lives. This is an enormous liberation. Before that, they were determined in their status structure, determined in their world structure that God wanted it that way, we cannot change it. Now an idea of freedom comes up. At first very hesitant, but the urge to say no is getting stronger and stronger. It is not necessarily God's will that few nobles live in mess and bustle, supported by corrupt church princes and the exploitation of the people. We can change something in our world. This is an incredibly liberating, great message. The other side of it, and this is very exciting for social work, is a new perception of poverty. If we perceive ourselves and our world in such a way that we are smeared by our happiness, and if we go into the Calvinist way of thinking, which even says, when I am rich, it shows that God has given me the ability to become rich, and I should continue to cultivate my freedom. If I am poor, it is no longer God's will, but also a product of my freedom. And suddenly I have a responsibility for my poverty. Was I still poor before because of the fate that God wanted it that way? Am I suddenly guilty now? I am poor because I have something hidden. God didn't want it that way anymore. If you are poor in the gut, it is uncomfortable both times. But it is even more uncomfortable now because you are not just poor because God wanted it that way. You are poor now because you did something wrong. And if not you, then your parents. But in any case, the guilt motive comes into the perception of poverty through the Reformation. And we still have this guilt motive. We have a lot of enlightenment at certain points. But if you think about how certain client groups are seen in social work, let's look at alcoholism, a disease according to ICD-10. Who has not heard at least once, maybe even said it himself with someone with severe alcoholism, it is his own fault if he drinks so much and does not get drunk. Such motives come up again and again. At least certain political parties see certain forms of poverty as an expression of individual failure. And that's why they approach the poor, the needy, with the demand to say they should help themselves. If you help yourself, then you help God. This is an epochal turn in the world view of poverty, which is very important for us to this day. That's why the view of the Middle Ages and then the Late Middle Ages and Early Neolithic. At the same time, we have an increase in poverty in the cities. This is due to the fact that there were land escape movements, that in the Middle Ages there were already laws that made city air free, so that relatives could flee to cities. And if they stayed there for a year they were free from their property, so that the cities became more and more full and the cities did not have endless work, so that poverty increased. And through the abolition of the church, also the responsibility for the care of the poor, which was before at the church, went into the communal hand, i.e. into the responsibility of the city. This is also a point that we have to take a closer look at. Because due to the reduction of the power and importance of the church, the church was suddenly gone if it was about taking care of the poor. Of course, there were still monasteries and of course there was still church help, but it was no longer the monopoly of the church to take care of the poor, so that the responsibility for dealing with poverty was transferred to the respective city, i.e. to the city administration. This led, on the one hand, to the communalization, i.e. the state, the worldly forces, were responsible for taking care of the poor and distributing the alms, no longer the church. And the first effect is then that it came to alms. In the medieval understanding it didn't matter at all. I gave as a rich man to someone and the church somehow distributed it. It didn't matter to me if I gave something to my poor Nuremberg or if I gave them something on the journey to Augsburg. It didn't matter. Now, where the cities are responsible for it, they have a different approach. They have to deal with poverty at least in the city, possibly fight it, and then of course have an interest that the alms they get, which they have available, are also used for their own arms and not for any other arms. At the same time we also have a rationalization, i.e. from the ratio of reason, the access to say, we don't do it anymore in such a high medieval importance, here is the money, here you have your arms, everyone takes what he gets, but you want to control the whole thing, you want to introduce criteria for it, who gets help, who doesn't. Questions were there, workability, family situation, possibly existing income and then also the financing of the care. Quite often it was in the medieval that if an old nobleman died, she invested her fortune in a foundation and then the money for fallen girls or for the Holy Spirit Hospital in Nuremberg. And the idea was to transfer these individual religiously motivated foundations into communal hands to use the money communally. The pedagogization is carried by this reformed idea to say, we don't have our poor as a state, who regularly get their alms, but we want to pedagogize the recipients of support in the bourgeois morality, i.e. change the bourgeois morality with the clear work ethos, who is diligent, earns money and can take care of himself. And a poor man has committed some misdeed that prevents him from getting his living in the bourgeois sense. That means we have to pedagogically influence these people and make them get rid of this mistake in their overall structure and finally not be poor anymore. That means they should work. There was also a duty to work and workhouses, because for a long time it was the opinion that if people only work a lot, this also changes their thinking and they become hard-working workers and citizens. Introduction of battle badges should on the one hand serve the administration, on the other hand also have this pedagogical effect through stigmatization. We'll see a few more images later. And you notice, all of a sudden work is being done in the alms area, where I still have my cheerful, gallant nobleman in the Middle Ages in front of my eyes, who, like with the carriages here and there, throws a few guilders through the area, we now have a urban structure where we have wishes, where we say we want to achieve something with our alms, we want to decide who gets them and human societies react to something like this by force with the education of bureaucracy. If you want to somehow bring the will of the people to the streets, then you build a layer of bureaucracy in between. You notice certain areas where many layers of bureaucracy have been developed over time. This is a negative aspect of this story. That is, you have to, as a city, of course, when you say I want to decide who gets the help, I want to use the help to change it a bit, someone has to do that. Someone has to decide, someone has to manage it. That means institutions were founded that have tested the whole thing and installed it, and someone has to do it. Someone has to do this professionally, so that we have the first heirs here, they were rather men, of our profession, who had to design this poor bureaucracy in the late medieval cities. What did it look like? The city council has formed a sub-council for the administration of alms. These were respected citizens. So here we have no contact to the stinking alms. You are not allowed to see that, but the noble citizens of the city have founded a council of noble citizens who should be responsible for the administration of the alms. They have come up with a battle order together, so who can battle when and where. They said who does it and had the highest supervision over the alms. From this council a nobleman was appointed, also an honorary citizen, a citizen of a higher status, a noble man, and yes, man, it would be nonsense to gender it now. And that was a very well-received position. He himself still had no contact to the alms. You are not allowed to see that either. He was a foreman, and he now had battle nobles in his staff. The battle nobles, as I said, were the forefathers of our profession. In Nuremberg we have reports that we had four, i.e. for the four districts, the battle nobles or battle nobles were paid for their job. And the job was to first check how far someone was in need and to distribute the alms. And to distribute corresponding battle badges, who was allowed to beg when and where. You know, we don't know much about the Middle Ages. What is surprising is that we have survived many regulations on how to deal when battle nobles or battle nobles are corrupt. That brings the conclusion that there was still rarely the tendency that useless laws were formulated that regulated matters that were not relevant. That means that if one saw the need to regulate dealing with corrupt battle nobles, there was probably a lot of corruption in it. Of course, you can also imagine that you manage money that you can give to some, not to others, without compensation. That just screams that there is corruption. Because of this, the job of the battle noble was very quickly lost. Here you see a Nuremberg battle, so this is a Nuremberg battle badge. There you see the Nuremberg coat of arms. There again. That's what the battle badges look like. The first institutions of medieval care for the poor were the hospitals. There is also in Nuremberg, especially the Heilig Geistspital to be mentioned. Hospital comes, you notice, in the Middle Ages, by Hospes, the guest friend, and means hospital was not necessarily primarily a nursing home. So you shouldn't imagine an early form of some complex clinic. But it was more a place where pretty much everyone was. So we had old and sick, of course, but it was also a nursing home for the a little crazy, for the village idiots and the like. It was a hostel for persistent craftsmen. It was also a night asylum for the homeless. So somehow everyone was there who had nowhere else found a place. There were even very few people who really got old are in the Middle Ages, but those who became were able to shop as friends. So, for example, have their assets to the hospital and had for housing rights. So it was a bit of the Pendant to today's old age home. The Pfründner, who paid to be there, also had the say. That was already the case back then, who pays, and then from their circles also chosen the predecessor. That was quasi the germ cell of stationary aid. There was everything in there that we otherwise have nowhere to go. Subsequently, from these hospitals then various stationary things developed. A high-tech advantage of the hospital, of the Heilig Geist Hospital in Nuremberg, you might have noticed when you were there. What could that be? What was an incredible advantage back then compared to other hospitals, you can still see it today. You know the Heilig Geist Hospital in Nuremberg? Yes? That's right, the geographical location is the decisive advantage, less the protection of the hospital in front of the city. Especially the fact that there is a gully in the middle that leads into the Pegnitz, where the various waste that occur in such a hospital everyday can be disposed of, was a great thing. They didn't know yet what a hygienic advantage it was, but then it didn't stink anymore, that's why they did it. And that was a very good facility, that you could achieve a hygiene level that was not natural for the time, which is still not recommended for today's time. That's how it was in the Middle Ages and in the outgoing Middle Ages. You can look at a thousand years of European history that fast. We even manage to put a few hundred years on it until we're done, but the New Age has the advantage that it is not so exciting for the development of social work. We can still have breakfast quickly today, then we have it off the table. Early New Age starts when the Middle Ages stop. Depending on when you agreed that the Middle Ages stop, the New Age begins and ends in industrialization around 1800. The New Age is shaped especially by the Thirty Years' War. So it starts around the Reformation. Shortly after the beginning of the Reformation were the First Peasant Wars. They were not yet primarily religious wars, they were rather distribution wars and then the Thirty Years' War broke out. That means it was a 30-year war in Europe and it was a religious war. Catholics against Protestants. You may not imagine the Thirty Years' War as continuous battles. That was not possible logistically at all, because someone still had to build food in between so that the soldiers could eat. But it was a 30-year war where again and again some princes went to war against each other and the main motif was war between followers of the Pope and Protestant forces. You can already guess that humanity is not so correct that it was exclusively religious questions. The whole thing was of course enriched with various political ideas. You can observe this in human history to this day. If you noticed back then as a little prince that you are Catholic and the neighbor is Protestant and also has incredibly tasty vineyards, then you will quickly become a fighter for the idea of the Catholic Church and tear his vineyards from the half-heath. And it is not really the religion that drives it, but rather the vineyard. Quite similarly, you can observe this in almost every corner of the earth in human history, that it always offers itself under the guise of a religious conflict to pursue one's own interests of power. This Thirty Years' War was so important that Europe was incredibly devastated. So the term devastation is already close. Europe was through after the 30 years. Then came Friedrich the Great and by the end of the time then the French Revolution. What was it called? The Thirty Years' War reduced the population in Europe by 25 to 40 percent depending on which sources they take and how they calculate it. If we play the game here again, in the optimal case, at 40 percent almost every second. So at 40 percent you can still look left and right and one of the two is no longer there after the Thirty Years' War. That means it was really at the end. And what came with it? The Westphalian peace that ended the whole thing. Augsburg here. Well, the Augsburg religious peace also played an important role in the Westphalian peace. But it was crucial that through the Westphalian peace the peace was created that was meticulously clarified which principality is Catholic, which is Evangelical. So that we had a carpet of principalities. Also existing principalities, dukes were not a nice state area that was somehow closed but was distributed in the map. And we had a huge chaos especially in the area of today's Germany which will be decisive when we discuss national issues in the later epoch. Furthermore, we had a certain technical progress. The mercantilist economic structure was a preform of a structure with factories as we have them later in industrialization. We have the first forms of division of labor and also alienation of labor. Here is Nuremberg from that time. How was life? Those who were not dead and we have already heard that there were not so many were rootless because they were drawn in by their prince at some point and then their herd was dismembered. So they moved through the area without roots. In the cities where there were mercantilist production a first early proletariat developed, i.e. first people who were exploited and who worked with minimal wages. Soldiers were deported after 30 years and they were deported and after the war not so many were needed and often did not know anything else. They moved through the area as well as craftsmen. What was new was that whole gangs formed of beggars who did not see themselves as beggars and victims but as social rebels and said, I do not beg, I do not need help. The fact that this had nothing to do with ethical standards at that time nobody cared. Today I hope that more people care. If we ask the story and say, did it work? If we make these things restrictive. Did it help that nobody came? If you say, you do not get anything, can you learn from the story? No, nothing helps. That's why we could leave it. For the time, the restrictive battle orders were installed and had to be implemented with the same structures that we know from the late Middle Ages. This did not lead to the better reputation of the battle slave. It got worse and worse. Then another instrument was introduced that we know to this day. When we find out that something goes wrong, there are different ways to fix it. You can reform it, you can change it, you can put it on new legal footing. It all costs time, effort and money. A cheap way is the renaming. I know it from my work as a social worker in Munich. There were a few street trains because a lot of people lived with social problems. This led to the fact that if you applied with the address of this street at a time labor company, you were kicked out because you said, this is the so-and-so street. The city of Munich pursued sustainable politics and said, we solve this poverty problem by renaming the streets. Then you knew what the streets were called in the new and didn't change anything. Back then, like today, nice attempt. The beggars were renamed to the poor or the policemen. Of course, it didn't work. So, again, if you knew history, the city of Munich could have let it be, because you already knew from back then that it wouldn't work like it did back then. The care facilities for the poor have changed a bit. Breeding and workhouses were introduced. The idea that we knew from the Reformation, that poverty is not an expression of God's will, but an expression of individual behavior, naturally leads to that I have to grab my arm and work on it until it stops being poor. And the pedagogical measure that was chosen for this purpose was breeding and workhouses. The idea was that if people only work properly physically, they will learn it at some point and be good, hard-working people. That's why the poor were brought into breeding and workhouses and had to do hard physical work. The staff that provided social assistance in these institutions tended to be craftsmen, i.e. people who could assess the work, less the pedagogy. And there are also many, very cruel stories. The head, the breeder, had absolute violence there. There are many people despising the delivery. That's also in the script again and again. If you want to look at pedagogically valuable things, in Michel von Lündeberger there is a part of the poor house where he helps the poor. And I think also in Pippi Langstrumpf there are places where it is recorded. You see here a representation from the breeding and workhouse. You might think this is a late-medieval fitness studio, because maybe some of you would like to get fit. Of course, that was not the point at the time. This hammer machine was driven by the wheel, so these things hammered something. And it doesn't look as happy as a fitness studio owner usually. That was the idea of the breeding and workhouses. At the same time, this was also the problem of the industry at the time. The only source of power was electricity. You could still decide whether by man or animal. But we didn't have stories like electricity and steam in the early modern times. What is also the spoiler for next week in the direction of industrialization. Namely, we get new sources of power and can thus redesign our industry. So much as a spoiler for now. We will discuss it later."
